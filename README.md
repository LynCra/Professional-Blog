# Professional-Blog
This project is a simple and professional blogging platform built using Rust (with Actix-Web for the backend) and a basic HTML frontend. It allows users to view, add, and delete blog posts. This application demonstrates how to create a basic RESTful API and integrate it with a static HTML frontend.
